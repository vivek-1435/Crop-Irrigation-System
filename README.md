Water Requirement for a crop - Based on ML model 

Engineered a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for multivariate regression, predicting optimal crop water requirements in mm/ha based on crop type, soil type, and region.

Implemented a dynamic data pipeline that queries the OpenWeather API to fetch 5-day precipitation and temperature forecasts, dynamically tuning the model's output for real-time irrigation decision support.

Designed the system to process categorical input features using One-Hot Encoding and ensure data consistency via StandardScaler, leading to a reliable and scalable ML solution for agricultural efficiency.
